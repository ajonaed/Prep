The Depth First Search(DFS) technique focuses on exploring one branch of the tree
as far as possible before backtracking.
This useful for problems requiring tree atraversal or handling hierarchical data

The main types DFS include:
    1. Pre-Order: Visit the root node first, then left, and finally the right 
    subtree

    2. In-Order: Visit the left subtree first, then root node, and lastly right 
    subtree

    3. Post-Order: Visit the left subtree, then right subtree, and then root node.

To Solve DFS-based problems, the approach generally involves:
    1. Recursive: Simple and follows the natural structure of a tree
    2. Itertive: Uses a stack to mimic recursion and helps in memory optimization.

DFS is ideal for scenarios where exploring entire paths or working with node 
relationships is essential.
