In many problems dealingwith an array or a linkedlist, we are asked to find or 
calculate something among all the subarrays or sublists of a given size. 

How it works on a list:
initiate below variables:
    window_start, window_sum = 0, 0


iterate the list using for loop:
    1. add a[i] to window_sum
    2. Check if i >= k - 1: -->
        1. Do what ever you have asked to do with the window_sum
        2. Update the window by doing below:
            1. subtract a[window_start] value from window_sum
            2. update window_start by adding 1.
