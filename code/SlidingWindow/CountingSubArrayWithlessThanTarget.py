'''Given an array nums with positive numbers and a positive integer target, 
return the count of contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target number.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six contiguous subarrays ([2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]) 
whose product is less than the target.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [8, 2, 6, 5], target=50
Output: 7
Explanation: There are seven contiguous subarrays 
([8], [2], [8, 2], [6], [2, 6], [5], [6, 5]) whose product is less than the target.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 0
Expected Output: 0
Explanation: Subarrays with product less than 0 doesn't exists.
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
0 <= k <= 106

            # boundary to the right until product is less than target.

                product /= nums[left]
                left += 1

            # Update the total count by adding the number of valid subarrays with the current window size
            # right - left + 1 represents the current window size   
            totalCount += right - left + 1

        # Return the result.
        return totalCount
