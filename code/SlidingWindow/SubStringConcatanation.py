'''You're given a string s and a list of words words, 
where all words have the same length.

A concatenated substring is formed by joining all the words from any permutation 
of words â€” each used exactly once, without any extra characters in between.

For example, if words = ["ab", "cd", "ef"], then valid concatenated strings 
include "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab". 
A string like "acdbef" is not valid because it doesn't match any complete 
permutation of the given words.

Return all starting indices in s where such concatenated substrings appear.
You can return the indices in any order.

Example 1:

Input: String="catfoxcat", Words=["cat", "fox"]  
Output: [0, 3]  
Explanation: The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".
Example 2:

Input: String="catcatfoxfox", Words=["cat", "fox"]  
Output: [3]
Explanation: The only substring containing both the words is "catfox".
